## Task Issues
### General
1. I have fewer features than others
1-1. Some features only appear when a specific controller is selected; try switching controllers.
1-2. The controller switching feature on the home page is currently malfunctioning; please change it in `Settings > Connection Settings`. The foreground controller is the mouse `Seize`, and the background controller is the mouse `SendMessageWithWindowPos`.

2. Task completes immediately upon launch
2-1. Check if the corresponding task is checked in the `Task List` on the left.
2-2. Disable in-game features that affect image quality, such as frame interpolation and super-resolution.

3. Unable to connect to a window or start a task
3-1. Ensure you have added MaaNTE to your antivirus software’s whitelist, or temporarily disable your antivirus software.
3-2. Ensure the game language is set to Simplified Chinese.

4. Unable to click or perform operations normally
4-1. Ensure your MaaNTE is located in a path consisting solely of English characters and contains no full-width characters (it’s best to avoid any special characters as well).
4-2. Ensure you are running MaaNTE as an administrator.
4-3. If you cannot click normally, try changing the mouse input mode to `Seize`.
4-4. Ensure Windows screen scaling is set to 100%.

5. Mouse Seizure Issues
5-1. In `Settings > Connection Settings`, change the mouse mode to `SendMessageWithWindowPos`. However, some tasks that require a foreground controller need `Seize` (which will seize the mouse).

6. Recognition Failure
6-1. Disable in-game features that affect image quality, such as frame interpolation and super resolution.
